The `doc-site` page component has an inbuilt header. Just using the `page`
header will appear on your page.

The header is built using [header](https://fastn-community.github.io/header) 
component.
Header uses `fastn.sitemap` which can be added inside your `FASTN.ftd` file.

Below is a set of simple sitemap links which you will see on the header and
toc-sidebar in your `doc-site` project.

Add the below code inside your `FASTN.ftd` file

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- fastn.sitemap:

# Home: index.html

- Liking fastn lang?: https://fastn.com/clean-urls/-/build/
- My First Article: /article-1/

# Star us on GitHub
  url: https://github.com/fastn-stack/fastn

-- ds.markdown:

In the above code snippet `Home` is the main section that will be active when you are
on the homepage of your `doc-site` project. OnClick of `Home` link it will take 
you to the `index.html` which is the homepage of your `doc-site` project.

Another link `/article-1/` will go to the `article.ftd` file which you
created inside the root folder of your `doc-site` project. And it will be seen
inside the `toc-sidebar` as toc link to the `Home` section.

`Star us on GitHub` will point to `https://github.com/fastn-stack/fastn` which
is an external URL.
