-- ds.h3: Sample `fastn.sitemap` code snippet

Below is a set of simple sitemap links which you will see on header and
toc-sidebar in your `doc-site` project.

Add below code inside your `FASTN.ftd` file

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- fastn.sitemap:

# Home: index.html

- Liking fastn lang?: https://fastn.com/clean-urls/-/build/
- My First Article: /article-1/

# Star us on GitHub
  url: https://github.com/fastn-stack/fastn

-- ds.markdown:

In above code snippet `Home` is a main section which will be active when you are
on homepage of your `doc-site` project. OnClick of `Home` link it will take you
to `index.html` which is a homepage of your `doc-site` project.

Another link `/article-1/` will go to `article.ftd` file which you
created inside root folder of your `doc-site` project. And it will be seen
inside `toc-sidebar` as toc link to `Home` section.

`Star us on GitHub` will point to `https://github.com/fastn-stack/fastn` which
is external url.
