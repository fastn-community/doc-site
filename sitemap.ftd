\-- fastn.sitemap:

# Home: index.html

# Star us on GitHub
  url: https://github.com/fastn-stack/fastn

In above code snippet `Home` is a main section which will be active when you are
on the homepage of your `doc-site` project. OnClick of `Home` link it will take 
you to the `index.html` which is the homepage of your `doc-site` project.

Another link `/article-1/` will go to the `article.ftd` file which you
created inside root folder of your `doc-site` project. And it will be seen
inside the `toc-sidebar` as toc link to the `Home` section.

`Star us on GitHub` will point to `https://github.com/fastn-stack/fastn` which
is an external url.
