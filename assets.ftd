-- ds.page: Adding Assets

In this section, we will learn about adding assets like images into your `fastn`
`doc-site` web site.

To add assets into `doc-site` project add folder inside it. You can also keep
your image assets into root directory. We recommend adding all your images into
a seperate folder to maintain your images at one place.

-- ds.h2: How to link image assets?

Let's say you have created a folder name `<images>` into your fastn project. And
you added a image `sample.jpg` inside it. 

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- ds.image:
src: $assets.files.images.sample.jpg

-- ds.markdown:

- In above code snippet `$assets.files` refers to your `fastn` project root
  folder.

- `.images` refers to your `<images>` folder you created inside your `fastn`
  project.

- `.sample.jpg` is the image inside `<images>` folder.

You can add as many image assets into your `fastn` project you wish to and
refers them as we seen above.
