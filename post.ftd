-- ds.h3: Let's understand above code snippet:

✨ `-- import: fastn-community.github.io/doc-site as ds` : imports doc-site and
all its components into your `.ftd` page. 

✨ `-- import: fastn-community.github.io/doc-site/assets`: helps to import
assets from `doc-site`. For ex., this assets import helps you to add images into
your `.ftd` pages.

✨ `-- import: fastn-community.github.io/doc-site/common`: helps to import
common properties and blog-related records from `doc-site`. These blog property
and records help you to add `post-meta` and `author-meta` records into your
`.ftd` pages.

✨ `-- import: fastn-community.github.io/doc-site/blog-authors/amitu as author`
import author metadata. You can add author details into `blog-authors/`. 

In the above example, we have added `amitu` which links to `amitu.ftd` file from 
`blog-authors/` folder.

✨ `-- common.post-meta meta`: helps you to add details of your blog post. 

✨ Using the `published-on` property you can add your post timestamp.

✨ fastn uses a specific format to add image assets you see in the above
`post-image` property. `$assets.files.static.image-placeholder.png` in this
`$assets.files.` is default.

fastn format to add an asset. `static` is a folder name, which you can see in
your `doc-site` folder structure. `image-placeholder.png` image file name, in
this case we have added a `png` format image. 

You can add any image format to it. e.g. `image-placeholder.jpg` or 
`image-placeholder.jpeg` or `image-placeholder.gif` etc.

✨ The `post-url` property will help you to add your `post.ftd` file. In this
case `/blog-articles/category-1/sample-post-1/` is the path of our sample post
`.ftd` file `sample-post-1.ftd` which is stored inside `/blog-articles/` is
folder and `category-1` is a category folder. You can rename it with your
desired name.

✨ The `author` attribute helps to add author details. `$author.amitu` in this
`$author` is imported via `-- import:
fastn-community.github.io/doc-site/blog-authors/amitu as author` line into your
blog post. `amitu` is a record type inside the `amitu.ftd` file which contains
author details.

✨ At the last of the above code snippet, you can add a few lines from your post.
This is called the body of the post in fastn. These lines will be added as
featured text inside the `post-list` page.
